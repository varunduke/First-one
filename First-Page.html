					<h2>Breeds</h2>
					<p class="pYellow">Dogs are the most variable mammal on earth with around
						<strong>450</strong>
						globally recognized dog breeds.[10] In the Victorian era, directed human selection developed the modern dog breeds, which resulted in a vast range of phenotypes.[7] Most breeds were derived from small numbers of founders within the last 200 years,[7][10] and since then dogs have undergone rapid phenotypic change and were formed into today's modern breeds due to artificial selection imposed by humans. The skull, body, and limb proportions vary significantly between breeds, with dogs displaying more phenotypic diversity than can be found within the entire order of carnivores. These breeds possess distinct traits related to morphology, which include body size, skull shape, tail phenotype, fur type and colour.[7] Their behavioural traits include guarding, herding, and hunting,[7] retrieving, and scent detection. Their personality traits include hypersocial behavior, boldness, and aggression,[10] which demonstrates the functional and behavioral diversity of dogs.[7] As a result, today dogs are the
						<span style="color:Red;">most abundant carnivore species</span>
						and are dispersed around the world.[10] The most striking example of this dispersal is that of the numerous modern breeds of European lineage during the Victorian era.[6]

					<h2 id="iRed">Population</h2>
					<p class="pYellow">The dog is probably the most widely abundant large carnivoran living in the human environment.[71][72] In 2013, an estimated global dog population was between 700 million[73] and 987 million.[74] Although it is said that the "dog is man's best friend,"[75] this refers mainly to the ~20% of dogs that live as pets in developed countries.[76] In the developing world, dogs are more commonly feral or communally owned, with pet dogs uncommon. Most of these dogs live their lives as scavengers and have never been owned by humans, with one study showing their most common response when approached by strangers is to run away (52%) or respond aggressively (11%).[77] Little is known about these dogs, or the dogs in developed countries that are feral, strays, or are in shelters because the great majority of modern research on dog cognition has focused on pet dogs living in human homes.[78]</p>

					<h2 id="iRed">Diet</h2>
					<p>Dogs have been described as omnivores.[12][87][88] Compared to wolves, dogs from agricultural societies have extra copies of amylase and other genes involved in starch digestion that contribute to an increased ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet.[11] Similar to humans, some dog breeds produce amylase in their saliva and are classified as having a high starch diet.[89] However, more like cats and less like other omnivores, dogs can only produce bile acid with taurine and they cannot produce vitamin D, which they obtain from animal flesh. Also, more like cats, dogs require arginine to maintain its nitrogen balance. These nutritional requirements place dogs halfway between carnivores and omnivores.[90]</p>
